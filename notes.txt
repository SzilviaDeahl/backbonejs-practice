Backbone components:
  -events: to add an object the ability to publish or sub events
  -models: application data
  -collections: a set of Models
  -views: to render models and listen for DOM/model events
  -routers: to create Single page applications

MODELS

Working with Attributes
  -song.set('', '') to set an attribute
  -song.get('smth') to read an attribute
  -song.has('smth') to check if the model has a given attribute
  -song.unset('smth') to remove that attribute from model
  -song.clear() to remove all attributes the model has
  -defaults:{} to set default values for the model. If the value is not initialized for that attribute, the default values will be set

Validation of Models
  -its convention to return a string error to be returned
  -to implement validation, we need to implement validate method on our models
  -entering song.isValid(); in console will check if the model is valid or not
  -enter song.validationError; will return the last validation error message

Inheritance
  -you can extend a method to use on another Model
  -however if you create a method inside the model, it will overwrite the inherited method in the base class
   and execute the one instantiated inside the Model
  -you can still call the method in the base class using the base method:
   you need to acces the prototype of the baseclass and then call the target method using the apply method

Connecting to the Server
  -backbone models use restful APIs on the server
  -simply call the fetch() method on the model, and the model will then take care of the AJAX call to get the data
  -backbone models support three operations to work with the persistance store:
    -fetch() to get the model from the Server (get request)
    -save() to insert or update the model (post-for new objects or put request for existing objects)
    -destroy() to delete the model (delete request)
  -backbone relies on a urlRoot property to construct the url to the corresponding end point
  - by convention backbone will assume that your model has an id attribute
    if that is not the case, you can specify which attribute will be used as an id attribute
      var song = Backbone.Model.extend({
        idAttribute: 'songId'
      });

COLLECTIONS

    collections are useful when you want to work with a collection of models

    -Every Backbone model has two IDs:
      -the first is the persistent id, that is assigned by the Server
      -the other is the cid, or client id that gets assigned by Backbone
       cid is a temporary identifier that Backbone uses to keep track of objects
      -to retrieve a collection from the server, we need to specify a url and call the fetch method
      -Backbone uses jQuery to make AJAX calls. As a result you can pass additional arguments to the API using the data hash
